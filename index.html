                                    <!-- <p>My name is Erik Sandstrom, and I am a junior data scientist and economist.  I am currently pursuing a Master's in Economics through George Mason University on a part-time basis, with an expected completion in the Spring of 2022.  I am excited to be starting my search for a great opportunity as a data scientist with a focus on economic analysis starting fall 2021.</p>

                                    <P>BACKGROUND: When the pandemic started in early 2020, I put some entrepreneurial endeavors on hold to help my brother-in-law with his painting company.  Though not a great fit for my skill set and career ambitions, I am grateful to have been able to help him have his most successful year ever while gaining valuale sales and project management experience.  Prior to that, I worked for Meagher Energy Advisors as an Engineering Tech.  In that role, I processed, visualized and analyzed large data sets surrounding oil and gas production, ultimately contrbuting to virtual data rooms geared toward the marketing and sale of oil and gas properties.  I have always had a deep passion for economics and an interest in data science, but my time at Meagher ignited a desire to go "all in" and pursue higher education in both fields.</P>

                                    <p>Most of my early carer was in the public policy realm.  As an independent contractor with iQu Strategies, I managed over a dozen consultants working on a massive public engagement effort to defeat several statewide ballot initiatives seeking to eliminate the oil and gas industry from Colorado.  The effort involved delivering technical presentations, targeted social media marketing, engaging with public and business leaders, writing op-eds, and more.  I directly oversaw the day-to-day effors in two of Colorado's largest counties while coordinating the efforts in an additional nine counties.  Ultimately, our efforts were successful!</p>

                                    <p>Going back even further, my first job out of undergrad was with the Aurora Economic Development Council as a Policy Analyst, then as their Government and Business Relations Manager.</p>

                                    <p>I majored in Economics and Philosophy with minors in Political Science and Spanish at Texas Christian University.  I later pursued a certificate in Data Management and Analysis from Colorado State University - Global Campus.  More recently I completed the University of Denvers Data Analytics Bootcamp concurrently with the start of my Master's program.</p>

                                    <p>Thanks for finding my page!</p>

                                    <p>My name is Erik Sandstrom, and I am an economist and a data scientist.  I am currently searching for a full-time opportunity to combine my analytics skills with my background in economics as I work through my final few classes in George Mason University's MA in Economics program.  I will complete the program and earn my Master's Degree in April of 2022.  I also recently graduated from the University of Denver's Data Analytics Botocamp.</p>
                                        
                                    <p>After graduating from Texas Christian University in 2010, my professional career has provided me with incredible opportunities to develop a diverse and flexible skill set.  I have experience in data analytics, policy analysis, project management, public engagement, sales, and much more.

                                    <p>I am a proud Colorado native, born and raised in Aurora.  I currently live in Littleton with my fiance and our black labrador.  I am an avid trail ultramarathon runner and an all-around mountain adventure enthusiast.</p>

                                            <p>Though I love virtually all topics in economics, recent events have led me to take a particularly strong interest in US Dollar inflation.  Starting as a Project for my data analytics bootcamp and continuing as an independent project long after, I wanted to create a research dashboard for economists like me to examine macroeconomic trends and to directly examine relationships between economic indicators.</p>

                                            <p>The user of the applciation can choose up to 5 data series to visualize on the line chart.  Additionally, the user may choose a background for the line chart that displays recessions, presidential administrations, or major world events.  The summary statistics tables to the right of the line chart give the user a handy way to compare the long-term changes and trends in the different series, and they re-calculate when the user zooms in in a particular date range or changes which series are displayed on the line chart.  There are a total of 123 different series to choose from, and the data is mostly sourced from the St. Louis Federal Reserve's FRED database.  A few of the series are sourced from the Wall Street Journal.</p>

                                    </div>
                                </div>
                            </br>
                                <div class="row">
                                    <div class="col-md-6">
                                        <p>If the user wants to take a closer look at the relationship between two series, I have included a scatter plot and a gauge to display the correlation between the two variables.  In addition to the 123 main series, the user may choose to examine the correlation between the "change" or the "percent change" between the variables.  Further, since some economic trends don't influence other indicators for several days, weeks or months after changing, the user may choose to lag the variable by up to 10 of the variable's reporting intervals (days, weeks, months, quarters, years), as well as filter to a precise date range.</p>

                                        <p>The Lag feature of this portion of the application was one of the most difficult things to build.  Because the data is reported on all different intervals, I had to pick a method of getting the data to match up if the user wanted to compare, for example, a weekly series with a quarterly series.  The first version of this application takes the "lowest common denominator" approach, where a weekly series is reduced to a quarterly interval to match the interval of the other series.  In a future version of the application, I plan to use a neural network for imputation of the series with the wider interval (essentially, to predict what weekly values of a quarterly series would be).</p>

                                            <p>Finally, I have included three models for predicting the level of inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE), and the GDP Deflator based on user inputs.  It is worth noting that these models are currently DEEPLY FLAWED.  They are full of omitted variable bias, biases due to correlated input variables, and none of the data was properly scaled prior to building the models.  I have chosen to leave them in the application despite these flaws because I like the user interface, and I will be replacing them with much better models in the near future.  I have already created some of the models in a separate-but-related project (see below).</p>

                                            <p>ARCHITECTURE: I am the sole author of this application.  I don't pretend to be an expert web designer, but I can do enough in HTML (Bootstrap) and CSS to get by.  The application is primarily built using a python Flask file in conjunction with a JavaScript (D3.js) file, an HTML file, and a CSS file.  The data is stored in a PostgreSQL database.  I invite anyone interested to take a look at the code on my GitHub page.</p>

                                            <p>I am extremely excited about this project!  Initially intended to be included in my Macroeconomic Research Tool project (above), I decide to separate this to make it its own project because I want to keep working on the various models for the foreseeable future.  This entire project is done in Jupyter Notebook, though I plan to integrate my favorite models into the Macroeconomic Research Tool.</p>

                                            <p>The first model was intended to give me a baseline for what the most basic neural network would look like with minimal data preprocessing.  It was built using a Scikit-Learn MLP neural network.  It has a single hidden layer with 100 nodes, and the training data is unscaled.  I used data from the end of Bretton Woods in 1971 through the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021.  The model did a poor job predicting the value for CPI based on post-pandemic inputs.</p>

                                            <p>Model 2 switches from Scikit-Learn to Keras and Tensorflow.  Similarly, it is a very basic neural network with a single hidden layer and 100 nodes, and it too uses unscaled data.  It does a slightly better job of predicting CPI, though it too is intended to be just a baseline.</p>

                                            <p>Model 3 also uses Keras, but this version uses data scaled using Scikit-Learn's MinMaxScaler function to scale all values to betweeen 0 and 1.  The model has a single hidden layer with 100 nodes, and it propagates through 100 epochs.  The improvement over the previous models is substantial, through the model is still not particularly accurate.</p>

                                            <!-- <p>Model 4 is the best model yet!  I increased the input variables from 8 to 12, there are two hidden layers instead of one (still with 100 nodes each), and I again propagated through 100 epochs.  Like the previous model, I again used Scikit-Learn's MinMaxScaler function to scale all variables between 0 and 1.  This model (an all above models) are trained on data starting 10/1/1971 at the end of Bretton Woods, and ending on 1/1/2020 before the COVID-19 pandemic.  Incredibly, the model predicted CPI for April of 2021 with perfect precision despite many of the input variables breaking from their long term trends once the pandemic began.</p>

                                            <p>Model 5 is a work in progress.  I intend for it to be a custom model loosely based on the Quantity Theory of Money.  I will model each of the four variables in the QTM separately, then create an ensemble model to predict the price level.  I believe the QTM is generally accurate in the long run, but there are short-term pressures that influence each of the variables in MV = PY.</p> -->

I continued with the company in a part-time role through September 2021 as I spent more time on my Data Analytics Bootcamp and double the normal courseload in my MA program.</p>

                                                        <p>I am extremely grateful for my time at Meagher Energy Advisors, as my role there solidified my desire to steer my career toward a combination of data analytics and economics.  Given a junior level opportunity to help distribute MEA's workload, I took advantage of great mentorship and lots of flexibility to experiment, ultimately learning a ton about python scripting, ETL, data preprocessing, data visualization, model engineering, forecasting, geomapping, and discounting.  My efforts as a key contributor to Virtual Data Rooms used to market oil and gas properties helped the company to record over $60 Million in sales.  Though it ultimately didn't sell, I am especially proud of my geomapping and data cleaning work surrounding a project spanning over 20 states that we valued at nearly $1.5 Billion.</p>

                                                        <p>The most exciting work I did was in TIBCO Spotfire, as it is the company's primary analytics tool.  Within Spotfire, I learned various scripting and visualization techniques, decline curve analysis, time series smoothing, and much more.  I also learned standard oil and gas engineering technologies such as Aries and PHDWin.</p>

                                                        <p>A close friend and colleague from my previous work at the Aurora Economic Development Council recruited me to be a part of his team at a boutique public engagement startup.  Though I contributed to several projects, the vast majority of my work centered around the management, oversight and strategic planning for 12 local community organizations in 11 different Colorado counties.  I served as the director of two of those organizations while managing the consultants who directed the other nine.</p>

                                                        <p>The goal of the local organizations was to combat minsinformation and bad publicity surrounding oil and gas development in Colrado, and ultimately to defeat a series of statewide ballot initiatives aimed at eliminating the industry from the state.  The effort included dozens of technical presentations, targeted social media marketing, writing op-eds, networking, and engaging with community leaders.  The effort was highly successful thanks to the incredibly talented and dynamic team we were able to assemble.</p>

                                                        <p>When our efforts ended at the end of 2016, I reached out to the Independence Institute to apply my Content Marketing and Strategic Planning abilities to what was previously a lackluster digital presence.  In just three months, I was able to increase their social media engagement and reach by 500% and 300%, respectively.</p>

I was hired as an entry-level Policy Analyst, helping the organization's efforts to support pro-business legislation.  My role grew over time, ultimately culminating in me leading several public policy committees focused on different industries and actively lobbying for strategic policy initiatives from the local to the federal level.</p>

                                                        <p>Perhaps the most exciting project I worked on in my time at Aurora EDC was the drafting and coalition-building surrounding an original piece of legislation.  The bill was my supervisor's original idea, and we worked with attorneys to draft a bill, and we traveled all around Colorado to meet with business organizations and political leaders to build support.  The bill ultimately died in a Senate committee due to nothing more than personal politics, but it was a multi-year experience that I will never forget.</p>

I enrolled in the University of Denver's Data Analytics Bootcamp, and it is one of the best decisions I've ever made.  Prior to the bootcamp, I could write some very basic Python code, and I could create visualizations using the GUI of pre-built tools, but I wanted to add a sophisticated analytics skill set to my background in economics.</p>

                                                    <p>The rigorous six-month bootcamp trained me in several different coding languages, advanced data visualizations, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and big data.  I became proficient or advanced using various tools such as Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio, Tableau, and many others.</p>

Having loved ecnoomics since early in high school, I started and finished my time at TCU as an Economics major.  Along the way, I was introduced to Philosophy, and I was instantly hooked.  While I love learning about different philosophical theories, it was really the logical process by which arguments are broken down that appealed to me.  I believe that Economics and Philosophy complement each other very well, especially when considering ethics and morality surrounding different economic policies.</p>

                                            <p>If you've made it this far down the page, thanks for reading!</p>

                                            <p>Outside of the professional world, I spend nearly all of my free time on adventures in the mountains or reading.  My main hobby is trail running and competing in mountain trail ultramarathons.  I also really enjoy mountaineering, backpacking, camping, and snowboarding.</p>

                                            <p>When it's time to slow down a bit, I love reading non-fiction books, in particular books on personal development, finance, politics, economics, spirituality, endurance training, and nature.</p>

                                            <p>Whether I'm running up and down mountains or curled up on the couch with a good book, my fiance Karina and our dog Frisco are almost always by my side.  The three of us live in southwest Littleton, Colorado, about 20 minutes from where I grew up and where most of my family lives in Aurora.</p>
